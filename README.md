The small widget shows new cases for a specific health region, province and all of Canada.
The medium widget shows new cases, active cases and tests taken that day for a specific health region, province and all of Canada.

A trend indicator shows today's new cases in comparison to last week's new cases.

The region can be set through the widget parameter or through constants in the code by either providing a health region code or a the two-letter province code.

The data is taken unaltered from the [COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group](https://opencovid.ca) â€“ only the trend indicator is added. The data is cached for when device is offline.

The widgets support dark mode and the appearance can be configured in the code. By default the appearance of the widgets change with the appearance of the device.
